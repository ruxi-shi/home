## About Me


I am currently a young investigator (tenure-track faculty) at [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University.


## Research Interest

I'm interested in dynamical system, ergodic theory and harmonic analysis. I am also concerned with spectral set conjecture on locally compact abelian groups.
